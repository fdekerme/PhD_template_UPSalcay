# PhD Template UPSalcay

This repository contains a Typst template for writing a PhD thesis at UPSalcay. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

- [Typst](https://typst.app/) installed on your system.

## Getting Started
  Just edit the `main.typ` file to set your thesis title and author name.

  NB : the table on the cover page with the jury members is not well integrated into the template (#show: template_UPS.with(...)) and needs to be manually modified in impl.typ.

- **Bibliography:**
  Update the `bibliography.bib` file with your references. You can directly export this file from Zotero (for instance)
